# Alfred Brook

## WHY ONLY BROOK WHILE YOU COULD GET ALL THE VPNS AVAILABLE?

i was personally using 3 VPNs:
1. VPN Unlimited¬Æ: the VPN is disabled if you don't use the app. so impossible to get Alfred to switch it on.
2. Wireguard: a pain in the ass to set up on your server, and each time you update the Mac app you lose all your clients LMAO. what a shitshow. Wireguard also gets blocked after a day in China.
3. Brook: super easily to install, indetectable, works in China, and the dev is HOT üî•Ô∏è.
